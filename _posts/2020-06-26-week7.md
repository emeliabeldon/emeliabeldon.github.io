title: Week 7 - June 22 - 26

Boom. Week 7 completed. 

We started this week with a brief team meeting to get the week's action plan set and me and Mike rolling. This week for me was more about getting the transcript up and running with no errors and bugs. 

As I mentioned last week, the code for the transcript had an error in the text streaming for the RTT feature in WebRTC. Every time a key is pressed - it is sent in a seperate line and not user friendly. So we needed to fix that to improve the UI. Before Friday ended, Norman drafted a code to fix that by setting a timer to detect inactivity and if there is none for 5 seconds - it would print all of the content that was streamed. So I started Monday with tackling and cleaning the code to get the text stream to stream fluently.
